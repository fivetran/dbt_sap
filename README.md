# SAP Transformation dbt Package ([Docs](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_sap/))

# 📣 What does this dbt package do?
- Provides recreations of the SAP extractor models to enable you to better understand your SAP data. The package achieves this by performing the following: 
    - Brings in essential master attribute tables like Company Code (`sap__0comp_code_attr`), Customer Master (`sap__0customer_attr`), Employee (`sap__0employee_attr`), G/L Account Number (`sap__0gl_account_attr`), Material Data (`sap__0material_attr`), and Vendor Number (`sap__0vendor_attr`).
    - Brings in general ledger models like General Ledger: Balances, Leading Ledger (`sap__0fi_gl_10`) and Line Items Leading Ledger (`sap__0fi_gl_14`).
    - Brings in master text models like Company Code (`sap__0comp_code_text`), Company (`sap__0company_text`), and Vendor (`sap__0vendor_text`).
- Produces modeled tables that leverage SAP data from [Fivetran's SAP connectors, like LDP SAP Netweaver](https://fivetran.com/docs/local-data-processing/requirements/source-and-target-requirements/sap-netweaver-requirements), [HVA SAP](https://fivetran.com/docs/databases/sap-erp/high-volume-agent) or [SAP ERP on HANA](https://fivetran.com/docs/databases/sap-erp/sap-erp-hana) and build off the output of our [SAP source package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_sap_source).
- Generates a comprehensive data dictionary of your source and modeled sap data through the [dbt docs site](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_sap/).


The following table provides a detailed list of all models materialized within this package by default. 
> TIP: See more details about these models in the package's [dbt docs site](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_sap/#!/overview?g_v=1).

| **model**                         | **description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

# 🎯 How do I use the dbt package?
## Step 1: Prerequisites
To use this dbt package, you must have the following:
- At least one Fivetran of the following SAP connectors:
   - [LDP SAP Netweaver](https://fivetran.com/docs/local-data-processing/requirements/source-and-target-requirements/sap-netweaver-requirements)
   - [HVA SAP](https://fivetran.com/docs/databases/sap-erp/high-volume-agent)
   - [SAP ERP on HANA](https://fivetran.com/docs/databases/sap-erp/sap-erp-hana) 
- Within the connector, syncing the following respective tables into your destination:
   - bkpf
   - bseg
   - faglflexa
   - faglflext
   - kna1
   - lfa1
   - mara
   - pa0000
   - pa0001
   - pa0007
   - pa0008
   - pa0031
   - ska1
   - t001
   - t503
   - t880
- A **BigQuery**, **Snowflake**, **Redshift**, **PostgreSQL**, **Databricks** destination.

### Databricks Dispatch Configuration
If you are using a Databricks destination with this package you will need to add the below (or a variation of the below) dispatch configuration within your `dbt_project.yml`. This is required for the package to accurately search for macros within the `dbt-labs/spark_utils` then the `dbt-labs/dbt_utils` packages respectively.
```yml
dispatch:
  - macro_namespace: dbt_utils
    search_order: ['spark_utils', 'dbt_utils']
```

## Step 2: Install the package
Include the following sap_source package version in your `packages.yml` file.
> TIP: Check [dbt Hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/) for the latest installation instructions or [read the dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/package-management) for more information on installing packages.
```yaml
packages:
  - package: fivetran/sap
    version: [">=0.1.0", "<0.2.0"]
```

It's our recommendation that you do not include the `sap_source` package in this file. The transformation package itself has a dependency on it and will install the source package as well.

## Step 3: Define database and schema variables
By default, this package runs using your destination and the `sap` schema. If this is not where your sap data is (for example, if your sap schema is named `sap_fivetran`), add the following configuration to your root `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
vars:
    sap_database: your_destination_name
    sap_schema: your_schema_name 
```

## (Optional) Step 4: Additional configurations
<details><summary>Expand to view details</summary>
<br>

### Filter the data you bring in with field variable conditionals
By default, these models are set to bring in all your data from SAP, but you may be interested in bringing in only a smaller sample of data given the relative size of the SAP source tables.

We have set up where conditions in our data to allow you to bring in only the data you need to run in. Configure the below variables in your `dbt_project.yml` to bring in only the rows that return these values in the fields specified.

```yml
vars:
    bkpf_mandt_var: 'value1' # The client field in the `sap__0fi_gl_14` model, this filter allows you to parse down to one client's records.
    kna1_mandt_var: 'value2' # The client field in the `sap__0customer_attr` model, this filter allows you to parse down to one client's records.
    lfa1_mandt_var: 'value3' # The client field in the `sap__0vendor_attr` model, this filter allows you to parse down to one client's records.
    mara_mandt_var: 'value4' # The client field in the `sap__0vendor_attr` model, this filter allows you to parse down to one client's records.
    ska1_mandt_var: 'value5' # The client field in the `sap__0gl_account_attr` model, this filter allows you to parse down to one client's records.
    t001_mandt_var: 'value6' # The client field in the `sap__0comp_code_attr` model, this filter allows you to parse down to one client's records.
    faglflexa_rldnr_var: 'value7' # The ledger field in the `sap__0fi_gl_14` model, this filter allows you to parse down to one ledger's records.
    faglflext_rbukrs_var: 'value8' # The company code field in the `sap__0fi_gl_10` model, this filter allows you to parse down to one company's records.
    faglflext_rclnt_var: 'value9' # The client in the `sap__0fi_gl_10` model, this filter allows you to parse down to one client's records.
    faglflext_rldnr_var: 'value10' # The ledger account field in the `sap__0fi_gl_10` model, this filter allows you to parse down to one ledger account's records.
    faglflext_ryear_var: 'value11' # The fiscal year in the `sap__0fi_gl_10` model, this filter allows you to parse down to one fiscal year.
```  

### Change the build schema
By default, this package builds the SAP staging models within a schema titled (`<target_schema>` + `_sap_source`) in your destination. If this is not where you would like your sap staging data to be written to, add the following configuration to your root `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
models:
    sap:
      +schema: my_new_schema_name # leave blank for just the target_schema
```

### Change the source table references
If an individual source table has a different name than the package expects, add the table name as it appears in your destination to the respective variable:
> IMPORTANT: See this project's [`dbt_project.yml`](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_sap_source/blob/main/dbt_project.yml) variable declarations to see the expected names.

```yml
vars:
    sap_<default_source_table_name>_identifier: your_table_name 
```
