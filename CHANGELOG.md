## Features
- **Added `sap_using_*` variables for modular staging**  
  - The package now supports `sap_using_*` variables to enable or disable individual staging tables. This allows you to control which raw tables are processed based on the data available in your SAP extract. Example usage in `dbt_project.yml`:
  ```yaml
  vars:
    sap_using_vbap: true
    sap_using_ekko: false
  ```
  - See the [README](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_sap/blob/main/README.md#disable-individual-sources) for more details.

- **Added variable `sales_and_procurement_mandt_var` to filter by client**  
  - This new variable `sales_and_procurement_mandt_var` enables filtering the new fact and dimension models (such as sales and purchasing documents) by SAP client (`mandt`). This is useful in multi-client SAP systems to isolate records for a specific client. Example usage:
  ```yaml
  vars:
    sales_and_procurement_mandt_var: ['100', '200', '300', '800'] # This sets the filter used in the sales_and_procurement models. The default is ['800'].
  ```
  - See the [README](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_sap/blob/main/README.md#filter-the-data-you-bring-in-with-field-variable-conditionals) for more details.

- **Consolidated `dbt_sap_source` into this package**  
  - All functionality from the [`dbt_sap_source`](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_sap_source) package has been merged into this transformation package. The source package remains available but is no longer required when using this package.  
  > **If you have any reference to `fivetran/sap_source` in your `packages.yml`, it should be removed.**

# dbt_sap v0.1.0  
ðŸŽ‰ This is the initial release of this package! ðŸŽ‰

## ðŸ“£ What does this dbt package do?
- Provides recreations of the SAP extractor models to enable you to better understand your SAP data. The package achieves this by performing the following: 
    - Brings in essential master attribute tables like Company Code (`sap__0comp_code_attr`), Customer Master (`sap__0customer_attr`), Employee (`sap__0employee_attr`), G/L Account Number (`sap__0gl_account_attr`), Material Data (`sap__0material_attr`), and Vendor Number (`sap__0vendor_attr`).
    - Brings in general ledger models like General Ledger: Balances, Leading Ledger (`sap__0fi_gl_10`) and Line Items Leading Ledger (`sap__0fi_gl_14`).
    - Brings in master text models like Company Code (`sap__0comp_code_text`), Company (`sap__0company_text`), and Vendor (`sap__0vendor_text`).
- Produces modeled tables that leverage SAP data from [Fivetran's SAP connectors, like LDP SAP Netweaver](https://fivetran.com/docs/local-data-processing/requirements/source-and-target-requirements/sap-netweaver-requirements), [HVA SAP ECC](https://fivetran.com/docs/databases/sap-erp/high-volume-agent/hva-sap-ecc-hana) or [SAP ERP on HANA](https://fivetran.com/docs/databases/sap-erp/sap-erp-hana) and build off the output of our [SAP source package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_sap_source).
- Generates a comprehensive data dictionary of your source and modeled sap data through the [dbt docs site](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_sap/).
